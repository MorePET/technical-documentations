## Changes

This PR adds Bootstrap styling enhancements to tables with a custom hover effect for the header row.

### Features
- Added hover effect to table header row's first cell (Stakeholder)
- When hovering over the header row, the first cell changes color to match other header cells
- Theme-specific colors:
  - Light mode: All header cells become #2563eb on hover
  - Dark mode: All header cells become #3b82f6 on hover
- Smooth 0.2s transition animation
- Disabled Bootstrap's default table-hover effect on header row to prevent interference

### Technical Details
- Modified `styles-bootstrap.css` and `lib/styles-bootstrap.css`
- Added CSS to override Bootstrap's table-hover CSS variables for header row
- Other header cells maintain their original colors during hover
- Non-header rows retain their existing hover behavior

### Testing
- Tested in both light and dark modes
- Verified header row hover behavior
- Confirmed other rows' hover effects remain unchanged
